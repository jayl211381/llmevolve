    "response": "Looking at this square packing solution for 301 unit squares, I'll evaluate it across the three key dimensions:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"simplicity_feedback\": \"The code demonstrates excellent organization and readability. The SquarePackingOptimizer class is well-structured with clear method separation - geometric operations (rotate_square_corners, get_bounding_box), collision detection (squares_overlap using SAT), and optimization logic are cleanly separated. Variable names are meaningful (half_diag, container_size, grid_spacing), and the code includes comprehensive docstrings. The main solving pipeline is easy to follow: grid-based initial placement \u2192 local optimization \u2192 container size minimization. However, some methods like optimize_positions could benefit from more detailed comments explaining the perturbation strategy.\",\n\n    \"rotation_feedback\": \"The rotation implementation is mathematically sound and well-executed. The rotate_square_corners method correctly applies rotation matrices with proper trigonometric calculations. The solution intelligently tries multiple rotation angles (0\u00b0, 15\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0) during grid placement to find better fits. The Separating Axes Theorem (SAT) collision detection properly handles rotated squares by testing all relevant projection axes. The local optimization includes rotation perturbations (\u00b15\u00b0) to fine-tune placements. However, the rotation strategy is somewhat limited - it only tests discrete angles rather than continuous optimization, and the 45\u00b0 maximum seems arbitrary when squares could benefit from other angles.\",\n\n    \"innovation_feedback\": \"The approach combines several intelligent strategies effectively. The multi-phase optimization (grid placement \u2192 local search \u2192 container size minimization) is well-designed. Using SAT for collision detection of rotated squares shows mathematical sophistication. The adaptive container sizing that tries multiple size multipliers (1.15x to 1.4x of theoretical minimum) is smart. The local optimization with perturbations in position and rotation demonstrates understanding of local search principles. However, the core approach is relatively conventional - grid-based placement with local improvements. More advanced techniques like simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, or physics-based simulation could have been explored for potentially better results.\",\n\n    \"overall_feedback\": \"This is a solid, well-engineered solution that achieves good practical results (76.4% efficiency, no overlaps). The code quality is high with clear structure and correct mathematical implementations. The rotation handling is competent and contributes meaningfully to the packing density. While not groundbreaking in terms of algorithmic innovation, it demonstrates good software engineering practices and produces a valid, efficient solution. The 19.843 side length for 301 squares represents reasonable performance for this challenging combinatorial optimization problem.\",\n\n    \"simplicity_score\": 8.5,\n    \"rotation_utilization_score\": 7.0,\n    \"innovation_score\": 6.5,\n    \"overall_score\": 7.3\n}\n```",
