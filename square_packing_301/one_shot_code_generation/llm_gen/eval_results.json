The SquarePackingOptimizer class provides good separation of concerns with dedicated methods for overlap detection, bounding box calculation, and container validation. However, the code becomes somewhat complex with nested loops in optimization and fallback logic in the main solver. The SAT implementation for overlap detection is mathematically sound but adds complexity. Variable names are descriptive and the overall architecture is logical.\",\n    \"rotation_feedback\": \"The solution implements rotation capabilities with mathematically correct corner calculation and SAT-based overlap detection. However, rotation utilization is quite limited - it only tries a few fixed angles (0\u00b0, 15\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0) in the grid placement and small perturbations (\u00b15\u00b0) during optimization. The rotation logic is sound but conservative, missing opportunities for more sophisticated angle optimization. The geometric transformations are correctly implemented with proper trigonometric calculations, but the strategic use of rotation for density improvement is underdeveloped.\",\n    \"innovation_feedback\": \"The approach combines standard grid-based placement with local optimization, which is a reasonable but not particularly innovative strategy. The use of SAT for overlap detection is mathematically rigorous. The multi-pass container sizing approach (trying different multipliers) shows some strategic thinking. However, the solution lacks advanced optimization techniques like genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, or physics-based approaches that could significantly improve packing density. The local search optimization is basic with limited perturbation strategies.\",\n    \"overall_feedback\": \"This is a solid, workable solution that achieves 76.4% efficiency with no overlaps, demonstrating mathematical correctness and practical effectiveness. The code is well-engineered with proper geometric calculations and validation. While it successfully handles the constraints and produces a valid packing, it represents a conservative approach that prioritizes reliability over optimization innovation. The rotation implementation is correct but underutilized, and the optimization strategy, while functional, lacks the sophistication needed for exceptional packing density. For a production system, this would be reliable; for cutting-edge optimization, it leaves room for improvement.\"\n}\n```",
